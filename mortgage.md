# Israeli Mortgage Engine - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

A specialized mortgage calculation engine designed to handle the complexity of Israeli multi-track mortgages (מסלולי משכנתא). The engine replaces legacy bank systems with modern, maintainable technology.

### Business Problem Solved
- Israeli banks struggle with legacy mortgage systems requiring 10+ developers for maintenance
- Complex multi-track mortgages with different rate types, terms, and adjustment triggers
- Manual processes for rate changes and amortization recalculations
- Difficult to scale or modify existing systems

### Solution Architecture
Modern FastAPI-based engine using a single PMT calculation with dynamic input adjustments per track.

---

## Core Technical Insight

**Key Innovation**: All mortgage calculations reduce to a single PMT function:
```python
monthly_payment = pmt(adjusted_rate/12, remaining_periods, -adjusted_principal)
```

The complexity is in the **input adjustments**:
- **Grace Period**: Interest-only for X years, then regular amortization
- **Prime Rate**: Rate = current Prime rate
- **Fixed Rate**: Rate never changes
- **Index-Linked**: Principal adjusted by CPI, rate resets every 5 years
- **Bridge (גישור)**: Short-term fixed rate

## Mortgage Structure Supported

### Example: ₪1,600,000 Mortgage with 5 Tracks

| Track Type | Amount | Rate | Term | Special Features |
|------------|--------|------|------|------------------|
| Grace Period (חסד) | ₪200,000 | 3% | 2 years interest-only + 10 years | Interest-only phase |
| Prime Rate (פריים) | ₪300,000 | Prime (4%) | 20 years | Variable with Prime |
| Fixed Rate (קבועה) | ₪200,000 | 6% | 20 years | Never changes |
| Index-Linked (צמוד למדד) | ₪300,000 | 5% | 20 years | CPI-adjusted, 5-year rate resets |
| Bridge (גישור) | ₪300,000 | 6% | 3 years | Short-term financing |

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **FastAPI** - REST API framework
- **Pydantic** - Data validation and modeling
- **numpy-financial** - PMT calculations
- **pandas** - Data manipulation
- **Python 3.9+**

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Models (Pydantic)
```python
class MortgageState(BaseModel):
    mortgage_id: str
    borrower: Borrower
    mortgage_details: MortgageDetails
    market_conditions: MarketConditions
    tracks: List[MortgageTrack]
    current_monthly_payment: MonthlyPayment
    amortization_table: Optional[List[AmortizationEntry]]
```

#### 2. Engine Logic
```python
class MortgageEngine:
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_payment(rate: float, periods: int, principal: float) -> float:
        return float(npf.pmt(rate / 12, periods, -principal))
    
    @staticmethod
    def calculate_track_payment(track: MortgageTrack, market_conditions: MarketConditions) -> PaymentBreakdown:
        # Dynamic rate and principal adjustment per track type
        # Single PMT calculation with adjusted inputs
```

#### 3. API Endpoints
- `POST /update-mortgage` - Main calculation endpoint
- `POST /calculate-payment` - Simple PMT calculator
- `GET /` - Health check

## API Usage

### Input: Mortgage State + Monthly Changes
```json
{
  "mortgage_state": {
    "mortgage_id": "MTG-2024-001",
    "tracks": [...],
    "market_conditions": {
      "current_prime_rate": 0.045,
      "current_cpi_index": 108.5
    }
  },
  "monthly_changes": {
    "new_prime_rate": 0.05,
    "new_cpi_index": 110.0,
    "calculation_date": "2024-10-01"
  }
}
```

### Output: Updated State + Changes Applied
```json
{
  "updated_mortgage_state": {
    "current_monthly_payment": {
      "total_payment": 12500.00,
      "breakdown": [...]
    },
    "amortization_table": [...]
  },
  "changes_applied": {
    "prime_rate_change": {"old": 0.045, "new": 0.05},
    "cpi_change": {"old": 108.5, "new": 110.0}
  }
}
```

## Testing & Validation

### Demo Scenarios Implemented
1. **Initial Calculation** - All tracks calculated correctly
2. **Prime Rate Change** - 4.5% → 5.0%, affects Prime track only
3. **CPI Increase** - 108.5 → 110.0, affects Index-linked track only
